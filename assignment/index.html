				<p class="paragraph">The Lalbagh Botanical Garden, Bangalore is of royal origin and was started initially as a private garden in an area of 40 acres by Hyder Ali, one of the most famous rulers of old Mysore in 1760. Initially designed in Mughal style, on the model of an extensive garden at Sira in Tumkur near Bangalore, this garden was further developed by Hyder Aliâ€™s son Tipu Sultan and subsequently by the British and Indian doyens of horticulture by extension of area and addition of a number of plant species. Of them, Major Waugh, Dr. Wallich, William Munroe, Sir Mark Cubbon, Dr. Cleghorn, William New, A. Blck, John Cameron, Krumbeigal, Rao Bahadur H.C. Javaraya, K. Nanjappa and Dr. M.H. Marigowda, as the Superintendents of the garden, have made noteworthy contributions to the development of Lalbagh. Today, the garden is a lush green paradise with an area of 240 acres in the heart of the city.</p>

				<p class="paragraph">
					Ulsoor, also known as Halasuru, is among the oldest villages in the city of Bengaluru and houses the Ulsoor Lake, which is considered one of the biggest lakes in the city. Renowned for its beautiful temples, the oldest of them being the Halasuru Someshwara Temple, this place starts from the eastern terminus of the MG Road and is situated in central Bengaluru.  The word 'Halasina Hannu' means jackfruit in Kannada and as there was a jackfruit orchard in the place, it was also named Halasuru. Thus, the lake was christened as Halasuru Lake, which was later modified as Ulsoor Lake during the British era.

					One of the major activities for tourists here is boating. The boat club of the lake arranges cruises that can be availed at a charge. The cruise takes you around the lake, with stopovers at some of the beautiful islands. This lake houses different kinds of flowers, birds and insects.The lake is also a favourite spot for morning and evening walkers.
